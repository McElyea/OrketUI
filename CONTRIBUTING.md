# Contributing

At this stage, OrketUI is not accepting external pull requests.

The project is undergoing rapid iteration and architectural changes.
Once the foundation stabilizes, contribution guidelines will be published here.

## Current Policy

- Pull requests: not accepted yet
- Issues: accepted for bug reports and reproducible integration failures
- Feature requests: accepted, but may be deferred without response timelines

## Before Opening an Issue

- Confirm behavior against the current API contract:
  - `C:/Source/Orket/docs/API_FRONTEND_CONTRACT.md`
- Include exact request/response details, status codes, and reproduction steps.
- Include environment context (OS, Node version, backend commit/date if known).

## Security Reports

Do not post exploitable details publicly.
Report security-sensitive issues privately first.

## Stability Notice

Large portions of this codebase may be rewritten or removed as the architecture evolves.
Breaking changes are expected during this phase.
