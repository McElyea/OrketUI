# Roadmap

This roadmap is directional, not a promise.
Priorities can change quickly while the project is still experimental.

## Near Term

- Harden frontend/backend contract alignment
- Remove non-contract endpoint assumptions
- Improve operator and replay reliability
- Reduce panel-specific state coupling
- Tighten BFF proxy behavior and error visibility

## In Progress

- UI layout experiments and panel behavior tuning
- Component cleanup and API normalization
- Runtime and event wiring simplification

## Planned

- Panel consolidation where overlap exists
- State management refactor for clearer ownership and fewer side effects
- Systematic UX pass after wiring is stable
- Better observability for panel data sources and endpoint failures

## Out of Scope For Now

- Public contribution workflow
- Long-term backward compatibility guarantees
- Visual polish as a primary goal over functional correctness
